## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL script to create the portal tables:

```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase/create-portal-tables.sql
```

This creates:
- `kid_profiles` - Child information
- `parent_profiles` - Parent/caregiver information  
- `videos` - Session recordings and lessons
- `lessons` - Mini lessons and activities
- `user_lesson_progress` - Progress tracking

### 2. Portal Access

The portal is accessible at `/portal` and includes:

- **Welcome Screen**: Magical introduction with feature preview
- **Kid Profile**: Fun, step-by-step questionnaire
- **Parent Profile**: Comprehensive family information
- **Video Gallery**: Session recordings and lessons
- **Mini Lessons**: Interactive activities and learning

### 3. Picture Login System

Kids can log in using picture sequences:

1. Choose a themed picture set (animals, shapes, foods, toys)
2. Create a sequence by clicking pictures in order
3. Use the same sequence to log in next time

**Security Note**: In production, implement proper hashing and storage of picture sequences.

### 4. Navigation

- **Portal Header**: Mode toggle (Kid/Parent), user info, progress indicator
- **Bottom Navigation**: Easy access to all portal sections
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for completion status

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Colors and Themes
The portal uses a magical purple-pink-blue gradient theme. To customize:

```css
/* Update these CSS variables in components */
--portal-primary: hsl(262, 83%, 58%);    /* Purple */
--portal-secondary: hsl(330, 81%, 60%);  /* Pink */
--portal-accent: hsl(217, 91%, 60%);     /* Blue */
```

### Picture Sets
Add new picture sequences in `components/PictureLogin.tsx`:

```typescript
const mockSequences: PictureSequence[] = [
  {
    id: '5',
    name: 'Space Adventure',
    emoji: '🚀',
    images: [
      '/images/picture-login/rocket.png',
      '/images/picture-login/planet.png',
      '/images/picture-login/star.png',
      '/images/picture-login/moon.png'
    ]
  }
];
```

### Lesson Categories
Add new lesson categories in `components/MiniLessons.tsx`:

```typescript

  // Add more categories
];
```
